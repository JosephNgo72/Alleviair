# Alleviair

Cloud-based mapping for disaster response (AngelHack @ Silicon Valley 2020)  
A web application that allows users to text our servers in the event of a natural disaster in order to crowd source vital information about road obstructions. First responders can then draw on this information in order to save time and lives.
